# PQC-Secure Streaming Protocol Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design of a quantum-resistant streaming protocol that provides secure, efficient data transmission for both web applications and embedded systems. The protocol builds on established streaming patterns (similar to gRPC) while incorporating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms to ensure long-term security against quantum computing threats.

## 2. Core Protocol Components

### 2.1 Transport Layer
- Built on HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (QUIC) for efficient multiplexing and low-latency streaming
- Optional fallback to HTTP/1.1 for compatibility with legacy systems
- Support for both binary and text-based payloads

### 2.2 Message Framing
- Length-prefixed frames for clear message boundaries
- Support for bidirectional streaming
- Header compression to reduce bandwidth usage
- Custom framing options for resource-constrained embedded devices

### 2.3 Interface Definition
- Protocol Buffer-like schema definition language
- Code generation for client/server stubs
- Service and method definitions with streaming options (unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional)

## 3. Post-Quantum Cryptography Implementation

### 3.1 Supported PQC Algorithms

#### 3.1.1 Key Exchange
- CRYSTALS-Kyber (NIST standardized)
- NTRU (backup alternative)
- Hybrid mode: classical (X25519) + PQC for transitional security

#### 3.1.2 Digital Signatures
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST standardized)
- FALCON (for applications requiring smaller signatures)
- SPHINCS+ (hash-based backup with different security assumptions)

#### 3.1.3 Symmetric Encryption
- AES-256-GCM for payload encryption
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 as an alternative for embedded systems

### 3.2 Handshake Protocol
- TLS 1.3-based with PQC algorithm negotiation
- Certificate validation using PQC signatures
- Forward secrecy with ephemeral key exchanges
- Support for pre-shared keys in constrained environments

### 3.3 Key Management
- X.509 certificate format extended for PQC algorithms
- Certificate transparency for PQC certificates
- Key rotation recommendations and automation

## 4. Embedded Systems Considerations

### 4.1 Resource Optimization
- Lightweight protocol options for constrained devices
